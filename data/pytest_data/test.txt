im feeling rather rotten so im not very ambitious right now;sadness
im updating my blog because i feel shitty;sadness
i never make her separate from me because i don t ever want her to feel like i m ashamed with her;sadness
i left with my bouquet of red and yellow tulips under my arm feeling slightly more optimistic than when i arrived;joy
i was feeling a little vain when i did this one;sadness
